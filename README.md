# D3ledger CRM Guide

### Purpose of this doc
To help D3ledger team to work with [Hubpsot CRM](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/5107533/companies/list/view/all/?) in a unified way via simple guidelines. 

### Work primarily with companies
We are interested in companies mostly. Companies came in via people so at first, we may add a person. However, afterward, we should add her/his company. We measure our progress by companies signed/lost, not by people contacted. 

### Work with leads, create deals inside a lead
A lead is simply a company with some potential. We may have many contacts inside a given company. Also, we may have several deals tied to a company. 

### How to add a company and what to fill in
You can add a company via [desktop CRM](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/5107533/companies/list/view/all/) or via mobile app [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hubspot/id1107711722?mt=8)/ [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hubspot.android&hl=en_US). You can scan a business card in the app. 

After a company is in the system, you should fill in several main fields:

* **Company onwer**: who is working with the company now

* **Priority**: *High* is what you plan on working soon, other statuses are self-explanatory. 


* **Lead status**. Our main metric is Lead Status. It can be:
  * Cold (just added in the system for the future)
  * In talks (we've contacted the company and trying to initiate a deal)
  * Deal opened
  * Won 
  * Lost (they won't work with us)
  * Frozen (no progress after 2 months or postponed)
  * Discarded (we don't see any potential)

  Please, always change Lead Status after you've made positive or negative progress with the company.

* **Role in D3**. 

  Self-explanatory: what type of a partner or client this company may be? **Do not add more than 2 roles to a lead.** If you    want to add more than 2, this means we haven’t qualified this lead good enough. It’s an essential field because we measure our success by how many companies of different types we have added in a given week, month, or quarter. 

* **Success estimate**
  
  How likely are we to sign a contract with this company? 
  
* **Other fields** 

  Everything else like the type of crypto services used or comments is optional. Fill those fields if you have some additional info.  

### Lead cycle explained

### When to start a deal
A deal is a potential sale or contract of another kind. Our KPIs are tied to the deals with companies, so it's essential to use deals. When to open a deal? Then there is a possibility of some contract to be signed. Types of contracts may include:
* MoU with bigger players, mostly validators and service providers
* NDA if we need to sign one before proceeding further 
* Actual contracts with clients, agents, validators
* Favorable resolutions made by a regulator

Please do not start a deal if you don't expect to sign some type of contract in the near future.

### When to mark a company Frozen/Deal Lost/Discarded
Do not keep any company in **In talks status** for long. We should either open a deal or freeze/discard a company. When to downgrade a company? 
1. If after two months and/or three interactions they don't show any potential, change Lead Status to **Frozen**
1. If they tell explicitly that they aren't interested, change Lead Status to **Lost**
1. If we came to the conclusion that a company is worthless (scam, no potential etc), change Lead Status to **Discarded**

### What to log into CRM besides lead fields and deals
We are trying to capture as much info as possible, so please log in everything you can, for example: 
* Calls
* Emails
* Meetings
* Team discussions of this company
